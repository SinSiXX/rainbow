# The Rainbow Engine #
You will find most of the top-level documentation in the headers.  
The basic workflow of understanding the engine is to read the corresponding
headers for a brief understanding of the module's functions, classes, etc.

## Implementation Details ##
The `src` folder will have implementation details and will be much more suited
for adding to the engine, rather then using the engine. 

## `README.md` Locations ##
Each folder will have a corresponding `README.md` which makes it quick to
understand a folder-tree in supported `git tree browsers` such as `GitHub`.
