# Rainbow Sources #
The Rainbow `src` directory contains the implementation details of the 
various modules as stated in the `include/README.md`. You will find a similiar
folder structure that will correspond to the `include` folders.

## `README.md` Locations ##
The `src` module implementations *will not* contain individual `README.md` 
as it is recommended that the viewer simply run the through `include` folder 
for an understanding of the layout--which include brief `README.md` to aid in
understanding the tree.
